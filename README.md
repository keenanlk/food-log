# Food Logger

- This app lets you log your food, while logging it tracks the location and allows you to enter comments and a rating.
- You are able to add friends and view their food logs and locations as well.
  - I implemented the google maps api into the app to view the locations.
- I originally started this app in the winter going into 2020 but had to take a break as school got too busy and haven't had a chance to pick it back up.

# Technology

- The front end is built with Ionic and Angular.
- The backend consists of a nodejs/express server and api hosted on Heroku with a mysql database hosted on AWS.
- The app does have PWA functionalities so you are able to add the app to your homescreen so it behaves like a standalone app you would get from the app store.

# Future Developments

- I had started implementing a photo-upload when logging a new food using google cloud storage.
- Eventually you would be able to add more information about your food such as macros.
